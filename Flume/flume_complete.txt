So here, basically we will need a SOURCE, CHANNEL & a SINK to perform practical of Flume.

Thus, we will be considering the following:

#1: SOURCE : netcat
#2: CHANNEL : Our computers main memory(it will act as a buffer memory and the data will go through it)
#3: SINK : HDFS will be the sink


#Firstly, we're supposed to send the Agent.conf file to the conf folder of flume and give the permissions to access this file

//To copy file
>>> sudo cp AgentNC.conf /usr/lib/flume-ng/conf

//To change the permissions to 777
>>> sudo chmod 777 /usr/lib/flume-ng/conf/AgentNC.conf
>>> sudo chown training:training /usr/lib/flume-ng/conf/AgentNC.conf


#Now, we will create a source using the telnet command on the port 44444
>>> curl telnet://localhost:44444

#Now finally open a new terminal and run this command:
>>> flume-ng agent --conf /usr/lib/flume-ng/conf -f /usr/lib/flume-ng/conf/AgentNC.conf -Dflume.root.logger=DEBUG,console -n AgentNC

Now, whatever we will write on the telnet terminal, will be saved into the HDFS at the location provided in AgentNC.conf file in chunks
